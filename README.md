# Gulp Build

Gulp Build is a general purpose build tool for Javascript/ECMAScript 6.

It will transpile, minify, and bundle your javascript source files, and watch for changes. This tool is especially helpful if you're writing ECMAScript 6 to ensure compatibility with Vanilla Javascript.  

For the React fans, Gulp Build also watches for .jsx files and transpiles them.
